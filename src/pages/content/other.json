          "text": "Going into college, I knew that I wanted to study abroad, and the question was always “Where and when?” and never “if?”.  During my Junior fall, after searching for different schools in England and Germany, I sent out various inquiries and applications. The weekend before my spring semester was supposed to start at CMU, I found out that I had been accepted to study a semester of Wirtschaftsinformatik at the Technische Universität Dresden.\n\nMy parents and I were beyond excited, as my dad’s family is still all in Germany.  Not only would I get to study in his homeland, but also spend time with my extended family that I only see once or twice every five years.\n\nBeing in Germany for five months really allowed me to connect with my dad’s culture. Being able to wake up and go to a baker and get freshly baked hard rolls and buying bratwurst from vendors on the street was incredible. (I absolutely love German food). It was difficult adjusting to constantly speaking and thinking in German.  Early on, I found myself having headaches at the end of the day, but I quickly adjusted.\n\nOne of the hardest things I had to do was take a database programming course that was taught in German by a PHD student that loved to mumble.  The worst part was that the final exam was 100% of the grade, and that it was verbal, meaning that I had to meet up with a German CS professor and discuss theoretical programming ideas with him… entirely in German. It’s safe to say that the weeks before finals were the scariest of my life. I thought it’d be a good idea to take 7 courses, as only the credits transferred and not the grades, allowing me to get ahead on credits that I needed to graduate at CMU. But with a lot of studying, hard-work, and luck, I was able to pass all 7 courses with the grades necessary to have the credits transfer.\n\nThe biggest takeaway for me though, while I loved studying at TU Dresden, was how much I truly loved studying at Carnegie Mellon. While the stress culture is a hard barrier to get past, once I started learning for myself and the sake of learning, I knew that it was perfect school for me, and studying abroad was an experience that solidified that for me.",

          "text": "Because universities in Germany have different semester timelines than here in America, I had a few months before flying to study abroad at TU Dresden. At the time, my dad needed some help setting up a few new computers and then connecting them to the server at his office. Therefore, I volunteered to help him out. I would leave with him in the mornings and spend the days working in his coworker’s office (she was out on vacation).\n\nThe work itself was simple enough, but it really helped me get a grasp of running IT at a small doctor’s practice. I was setting up about 10 computers, installing the specific software for their specific user’s needs, while also connecting them to the server/database that they had running out of the basement.\n\nWhile waiting for software to install (I’d be setting up 3-4 machines at any given time) I’d usually be asked for some IT help by the different employees in the office, so there was not too much downtime waiting for these installations to happen.\n\nAfter the machines were completed, I would set them up in their specific offices after the employees left, and then head to the back room to ensure that the Ethernet connecters were live to the specific ports. Overall, I worked here about 2-3 times a week for 3 weeks before everything was completed and operational.",

Throughout these trips, we had the chance to help with construction work, with projects ranging from building a slide for a school, to putting roofs on shelters and homes, to helping build the foundation for a church at an orphanage.  We had the chance to truly make a difference in the lives of people who needed our help.\n\nTrips like these really open your eyes to the scale of the world. While it is so large, it’s also paradoxically very small. If you never leave your home or town, I don’t think you could ever understand the amount of need there is in this world.\n\nI may have only been in middle school, but these trips served as a foundation for who I am today. I truly strive to work somewhere where I can believe in what I’m doing, while also having the chance to make a difference in the world, whether it be the company’s main goal or side projects that they have running. I want to be able to do good in this world, and work somewhere where I will not be compromising my morals.",
