          "text": "Since I’ve returned from my adventure in Palau, I’ve had to face the reality of applying to jobs. However, this did not take up all of my time and I found myself stuck with a lot of free time.\n\nThat free time ended up being used to explore a lot of the aspects of front-end design and development. I was messing around with ReactJS when I started thinking about making a personal website. I had the (what I think to be very funny) idea to recreate my PDF resume as if it was opened in Chrome, but I wanted to make it interactive. I realized that, because of its heavy use of components, ReactJS would be the perfect tool to use for this project. My life began to compose itself of job applications, front-end development, and my daily routine of sleeping, eating, and singing.\n\nA few weeks later, I overheard a family-friend talking about his Agriculture Consulting company.  Out of curiosity, I asked if they had a website, and he said (very hesitantly) that they had a site created through GoDaddy’s website builder. He started to explain that most of his clients tend to be living in very rural areas, and don’t use the computer that much, so he hasn’t had the need to invest in a better site. However, he said it would be nice for his larger more business-oriented clients, or for new clients who are searching online.\n\nWe started talking to about his competition, and he started listing a few companies and sent me their websites. I tried opening them in my phone but none of them were mobile-friendly. I knew instantly that there was an opportunity here.\n\nAs we started talking more, I realized that I had the chance to share my talents with him, and save him a bunch of money that other developers would probably charge.\n\nAbout a month later, I found myself working on websites for a podcast, a camp reunion, a fantasy football game, and of course, the Agriculture Consulting company. While it’s nothing official, I’ve stumbled my way into starting a website consulting business.\n\nThe projects that I am working on are still in progress, and therefore I cannot release pictures from most of them, but I have included pictures of the Agriculture Company’s current website, compared to one of the early prototypes delivered to the client.",

          "text": "As I was taking 67-373, my professor Joseph Mertz gave a short talk about the Technology Consulting in the Global Community (TC in the GC) program. When he started describing past projects and the effects that past students had had, I knew that I would regret not applying for the program. Then about two weeks before graduation, I received an email saying that I had been accepted, and that I would be flying out to Palau a week after I graduated.\n\nI spent the summer of 2017 working for Palau's Ministry of Education. The project itself involved revitalizing the system for teacher observations, which was previously all paper/excel based.\n\nI spent the first few weeks analyzing the process and trying to find an existing solution that could be used to solve their problem. However, after these few weeks and discussion with the teaching specialists, the managers, and the tech support, every existing solution was too large and not catered enough to their needs. So, despite the tradeoff of immediate sustainability, it was decided that a custom full-stack solution would be the best approach for this project.\n\nI spent the rest of the summer developing a Ruby on Rails solution due to my experience in the language and the speed in which development can happen. It was quite the challenge though, as I was developing an entire full-stack web application in 6 weeks, and so I developed the front-end and back-end simultaneously. I started the front-end by using a static template and then plugging in aspects of material design and linking the controllers. The back-end was run using a MySQL database to match what is currently used in the different MoE servers. Then in the last week, it was a mad dash to ensure that the server could get up and running. I spent most of those nights integrating the application with the current log-in server that was run at the MoE and finally served it off of Apache with a day to spare. The project itself also has the basis to be built upon for future expansion and will be worked on by CMU student-consultants in the following four years.\n\nOutside of working for the MoE, I got the chance to become certified in scuba diving while also overcoming one of the greatest fears of my early life: water. I almost drowned a few times when I was little, and therefore I didn’t learn how to swim until I was 12. I still hate the feeling of water on my face and felt completely vulnerable under water. So taking this opportunity allowed me to confront that fear. I can proudly say that I am a certified PADI Open-Water Diver, and without the TC in the GC program, I would never have had the chance.\n\nThis experience was amongst the greatest in my life. Nothing can really compare to flying halfway around the world and getting the chance to affect the education system of an entire country. I will truly remember this for the rest of my life.",

          "text": "My Senior Spring, I took 67-373: Software Development Project, a course which places IS students into groups of three or four and has them work with non-profits to analyze processes and (usually) develop software solutions to improve their workplace. \n\nThis course was normally the Information Systems course that we should take during our Junior Spring; however, I was studying abroad at that time, and so I took a course at TU Dresden to replace 373. That being said, it was an experience that I really wanted to have, so after some discussion with my advisor, I was allowed to take it my senior year (thanks Gary!).\n\nNow this course is dedicated to two things: allowing students to build real world experience, and helping improve the community, from local Pittsburgh non-profits to schools across the country (one group had the opportunity to work with a school in Alaska).\n\nI, along with two of my classmates, had the opportunity to be paired with the Beaver County Humane Society. The thing that made this project unique was that it was actually the continuation of a project that was started in 2016, so going into it, our client had a strong idea of what they needed, as they had a compiled list of bugs that had to be fixed. Therefore, we spent a majority of our semester working on these bugs. However, there was one drastic problem that we noticed existing in the application, and that was the total lack of design put into the project, so this is where I took the lead.\n\nHaving just worked on a few personal projects with Website Design, most of the topics were still fresh in my mind. I began the redesign by exploring existing static theme ideas and using this research to build them a real landing page. From here, it was a process of going through the existing content and making it match the homepage design. But I went even further. Near the beginning they had discussed the idea of building an app for their Foster Portal. I addressed this by making the entire application mobile friendly and editing the search-bars to turn into popout menus to make the overall experience more friendly to mobile. \n\nEspecially near the end of the semester, I put many more hours in than was required, but it was worth it. I was able to enhance the project to be something that truly had the BCHS stamp on it. These were wonderful people and they deserved a wonderful project that they can use to save lives.",

Music (next to computers) has always been one of the greatest passions of my life. Pretty soon, it became my most involved extracurricular at CMU.\n\nMy Senior Spring, I found out that we actually had an old website, and so I went to look it up. Putting it nicely, it was pretty terrible. Someone had made it back in the early 2000’s and there was no real sense of design. So I recruited Sean (both a fellow IS major and Bass in the group) to help try and create something better.\n\nI began the development of the project using Jekyll, a gem/static-site generator that is integrated with Ruby, and I found an existing theme to get an idea of how the gem worked. It was pretty cool, because it allowed the use of markdown throughout the project while also allowing it to be broken up into multiple files. This made development significantly easier, allowing Sean and I to work simultaneously by using GitHub without having to worry about the merge conflicts that normally come with single page sites. I was in charge of most of the development while Sean addressed the more detailed design features. Working on this project was really what kicked off my work into website creation and design, and without it, I never would have attempted making this site.\n\nThe site itself is still running today and hosted on GitHub Pages, being currently managed by members currently in the group (though I have been contacted with questions about maintenance so I still contribute at points). The hope is that the site will continue to grow, and hopefully will be the future location for all of our content.",

The course itself is broken up into two sections: a shorter 5-week project, and a larger 10-week project. The earlier project was more of an introduction to the course, and there was no real theme beyond “innovate.” However, the second project was given the constraint of creating an innovation in Healthcare and Wellness at CMU.\n\nWhen my group first got together, we brainstormed different aspects of health that we could try and innovate on, and through discussion, we ended up on the topic of campus safety. What started as an idea for an application that links friends together in order to ensure that they get home safely turned into SafetyPin: an all-encompassing CMU safety application idea that was heavily map-based and linked all of the campus safety information together (such as the locations of shuttles, Blue Lights, crime alerts, etc.).\n\nMost of my contribution revolved around the development of the iOS front end, and creating most of the interactive front-end in Xcode. This involved creating the sliding displays, pop-up notifications, part of the interactive maps, and a unifying design throughout the application. This project definitely helped me develop my UI/UX skills, while also creating more of a foundation with my Swift skills.\n\nThe project developed to the point where we were communicating with CMU Police in order to try and have this possibly be an official application managed by them. The project itself is currently still in the development stages, with the hope that it can eventually make a CMU a safer place.",
